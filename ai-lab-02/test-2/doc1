Deep in the forest, a small, ivy-covered cottage stood quietly beneath towering trees. The air was filled with the scent of pine and the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze. The old woman who lived there spent her days gathering herbs and watching the deer wander through the nearby meadow. As evening fell, she would sit on her porch, sipping tea and listening to the birds as the sun set behind the distant hills, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.
