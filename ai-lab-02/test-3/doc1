Hidden in the woods, a quaint, vine-clad cottage stood silently beneath towering trees. The air was filled with the aroma of cedar and the gentle whisper of leaves in the wind. The elderly woman who resided there spent her days collecting herbs and observing the rabbits roam through the adjacent meadow. As dusk approached, she would relax on her porch, sipping herbal tea and listening to the songbirds as the sun dipped behind the far-off hills, coloring the sky in hues of gold and lavender.
