Nestled by the shoreline, a charming seaside villa perched on a cliff overlooking the vast ocean. The atmosphere was filled with the salty scent of the sea and the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the rocks. A retired sailor inhabited the villa, spending his mornings fishing from a small boat and watching the gulls glide gracefully overhead. As twilight descended, he would enjoy a glass of wine on his balcony, listening to the distant laughter of children playing on the beach while the horizon transformed into brilliant shades of crimson and indigo.
